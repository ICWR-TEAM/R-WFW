# Controller Usage Documentation

## Overview

`App\Core\Controller` acts as the base class for all HTTP controllers. Provides access to rendering views, instantiating models, and managing request-response flow. Automatically loads `Config` and `Security` during construction. Meant for handling route dispatch logic and response construction. Not intended to contain low-level data access or business rules.

---

## Base Controller Features

```php
$this->view('path/to/view', ['key' => 'value']);
$this->model('ModelName/SubPath');
$this->request->getMethod();
$this->response->json(['ok' => true]);
````

Controllers receive URL parameters and can optionally access request/response instances if injected via the router.

---

## View Rendering

```php
$this->view('templates/header', ['title' => 'Home']);
$this->view('pages/index', ['items' => $items]);
$this->view('templates/footer');
```

Calls to `view()` resolve relative to `../app/views/`, append `.php`, and include provided `$data` as scoped local variables.

---

## Model Instantiation

```php
$model = $this->model('UserModel/SubPath');
$data = $model->fetchById($id);
```

Loads model from `../app/models/`, resolves full namespaced class path, and returns new instance. All models must follow PSR-style naming.

---

## Request and Response Access

```php
$payload = $this->request->getJSON();
$this->response->withStatus(200)->json(['data' => $payload]);
```

Injected automatically into controllers extending base `Controller`. Enables full HTTP lifecycle handling inside controller actions.

---

## Route Mapping

```php
$route->Route('GET', '/item/{id}', 'ItemController::detail');
```

Controller methods can receive `$params`, optionally `$request` and `$response` if router dispatches them. Signature must match route injection.

---

## Example Controller

```php
namespace App\Controllers;

use App\Core\Controller;

class ProductController extends Controller
{
    public function show($params)
    {
        $product = $this->model('ProductModel')->find($params['id']);
        $this->view('product/show', ['product' => $product]);
    }

    public function apiCreate()
    {
        $data = $this->request->getJSON();
        $this->model('ProductModel')->create($data);
        $this->response->withStatus(201)->json(['created' => true]);
    }
}
```

Separation of concern between view-based and API-oriented actions. Both rely on base controller capabilities.

## Summary

Base `Controller` acts as execution entry point for route handlers.
Provides unified interface to view rendering, model access, and HTTP interaction.
Should not include persistence or domain logicâ€”delegate to models or services.
Designed for direct use in routing layer and supports parameterized route mapping.
Built-in `Config` and `Security` auto-loaded per instance.
Response and request utilities tightly integrated for streamlined web control flow.
